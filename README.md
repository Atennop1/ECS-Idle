## About project

This is a mini-project that was made in order to understand the idea behind the ECS approach after a long time building software architecture with OOP and object design.<br>
The project was not completed, because a few days after the start of development, I realized that I had chosen the wrong genre for studying ECS. I chose to make an Idle game, where in my opinion an OOP approach is more suitable.<br>
In the game itself, a money system, automatic miners and saves for all this were implemented.

### Specifics
- Project using **ECS**
- In some places, **ECS** is intertwined with **OOP**
- The shortest project in terms of development time
- The first project that was stopped due to the wrong architecture

## Conclusion

This project helped me gain a basic knowledge of the ECS approach, which I have been avoiding a lot because I like OOP. I also realized that you should not go too far in mixing OOP and ECS, because this will only lead to unnecessary complexity of the system, because ECS is a DOD approach, but OOP is not.
